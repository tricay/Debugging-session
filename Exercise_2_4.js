/*
 * SCENARIO: A simple bank account ledger applies a series of transactions (deposits and withdrawals) and prints the final balance. The final balance is wrong.
 * TASK: Use the debugger (or add console.log at each step) to trace the value of balance through every transaction. Find and fix the bug.
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT:
 * Final balance: $1500.00
